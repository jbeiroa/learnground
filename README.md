# Juani's learnground

Hi! I'm [Juani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jibeiroa/), a physics teacher stepping into AI and Data Science. I've been teaching secondary school physics and technology for about 7 years and, since June 2022, I've been also working as an advisor to the Secretary General of the Federal Council of Education in Argentina. My work there has been a mixture of basic data analytics (mostly, I assist in joint committees and monitor and analyze salary indicators) and collaboration in the design and monitoring of medium and long-term federal educational policies.

This job as an advisor has renewed my passion for working with data and I've taken the year 2023 to learn as much as I can and look out for jobs in the fields of data science and analytics. 

I will be using this repo as a learning playground, mainly about data science and analytics with python, but not limited to it.
